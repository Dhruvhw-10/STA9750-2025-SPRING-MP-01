<p>📌 <strong>Insight:</strong><br>
Instead of paying costly overtime, <strong>hiring additional full-time employees</strong> would reduce long-term payroll costs <strong>while improving work-life balance</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>📊 Final Recommendations:</strong></p>
<p>✔ <strong>Reduce overtime in non-essential roles</strong> like <strong>Clerks &amp; Admin Assistants</strong>—50% reduction could save millions.<br>
✔ <strong>Expand remote work</strong> for IT, Analysts, and Project Managers to reduce office space and commute-driven overtime.<br>
✔ <strong>Hire full-time employees</strong> to replace reliance on overtime in high-workload agencies.</p>
